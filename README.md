   - Create an Rails Application to get x repositories from github users.
   - Users should have:
     - Link to github;
     - Repositories;
     - Latitude and longitude;

   - Create an end-point to find out which users are nearest from a given point;
   - Given 2 users, return the best route from point A user location to B user location through other users location;


   Some points we will look at

     - code design;
     - problem-solving ( try to do it without gems );
