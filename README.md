Muove - Challenge

 - Create an Rails Application to get x repositories from github users.
 - Users should have:
   - Link to github;
   - Repositories;
   - Latitude and longitude;

 - Create an end-point to find out which users are nearest from a given point;
 - Given 2 users, return the best route from point A user location to B user location through other users location;


 Some points we will look at

   - code design;
   - problem-solving ( try to do it without gems );

 Good Luck and have fun! : )
